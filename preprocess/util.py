    This function normalizes a time-frequency representation S by
    performing automatic gain control, followed by nonlinear compression:

    P[f, t] = (S / (eps + M[f, t])**gain + bias)**power - bias**power
    PCEN is a computationally efficient frontend for robust detection
    and classification of acoustic events in heterogeneous environments.

    This can be used to perform automatic gain control on signals that
    cross or span multiple frequency bans, which may be desirable
    for spectrograms with high frequency resolution.

    Args:
        spectrograms: The data from the audio file used to create spectrograms.
        sampling_rate: The sampling rate of the audio files.

    Wavelet denoising is an effective method for SNR improvement
    in environments with wide range of noise types competing for the

    Wavelet denoising relies on the wavelet representation of
    the image. Gaussian noise tends to be represented by small values in the
    wavelet domain and can be removed by setting coefficients below
    a given threshold to zero (hard thresholding) or
    shrinking all coefficients toward zero by a given
    amount (soft thresholding).
